DBUGGING HIRING: WHAT WENT RIGHT 	AND WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE 	TECHNICAL INTERVIEW PROCESS
The author of this title is “Mahnaz Bheroozi”, “Shivani Shirolkar”, “Titus Barik”, “Chris Parnin”. It`s conference name is “International Conference on Software Engineering” (ICSE-SEIS’20), it was published on “May 23-29, 2020”at “Seoul, republic of Korea”. 

INTRODUCTON:
This discussion about hire the new employees for join the companies. This pipeline for software engineering candidates, who gives the interview. This pipeline arranges the Interview days, interview conducted over the mobile(video) and through online system platforms. If candidates select in this interview process so we are invited to candidates for one more technical interview that involves whiteboard or simple text editor.
In this hiring pipeline, the chronological process yields a positive result for all interviewers who take the decision for hire those candidates who deserved this job.
The candidate is happy that they have found a job according to their skills, interest and values, the company is confident about the employee and those candidates rejected in the technical interview, they have better understanding that they were not a good fit for the job. They need to improve, this is motivation of the debugging hiring



  IMPORTANCE OF DBUGGING HIRING:
The importance of debugging hiring is conducting the interviews, select the best candidates for the companies.
•	A candidate`s first conversation with your company, typically discussion about new ideas for the company and tells about which companies are good for new deals, is the important step for hiring process.
•	Interview process say a lot about your organization, if your company unorganized so you are losing top candidates.
•	First impression matter about both company and candidates.
•	Candidate have positive experience.
•	To ask question about related to job.
If only two candidates apply two openings, you may have choice to hire them. But if 20 candidates apply so you can use techniques (online system)

METHODOLOGY:
In the content of software engineering debugging is the process to understand that how to become disengaged during the hiring process, it refers to identify and analysis the qualitative on interview reviews, then we collect the data about technical interviews for software engineering position. Glass door.com is a website for find the job that`s fit your life. In this field so many companies a appear in this website there are at least 50 reviews on Glass door. This yielded a total of 19 companies to collect the data. Reviews spanned from March 5, 2009 to June 25, 2019.
Organize our collected data in to reviews such as ‘Positive Experience’ and Negative Experience’ we analysis the reviews if they did not a positive and negative experience. We removed the non-informative reviews.

RESULT:
We discuss the result about both negative (what went wrong) and positive (what went right) there are some themes found studying the hiring pipeline.
and give example about what went wrong and what went right.

Contact:
In this theme we ask about candidate’s experiences on the initial phases in the hiring pipeline and candidate response to the recruiter. Paying attention to details where recruiter make mistake in matching the candidate to a position. Responsive can keep candidates a potentially long and uncertain hiring process, candidate except recruiter to response in a timely manner throughout the hiring process. Example: (What went wrong?) “I tried calling back the recruiter but they just do not respond. . .had to withdraw my application.” 
(What went right?) “I got prompt response from this point till the end. . . everyone was professional.” 

Preparation:
After initial phases companies prepare the candidates for what to expect. Interview scheduling important in the hiring process. Candidate were not available to proceed with the interviews. hiring criteria when companies went accurate result but companies are not clear on their hiring criteria.
Example: (What went wrong?) “My interview was rescheduled three times, which
as a candidate provides a terrible experience, especially as I am currently
employed full-time.”
(What went right?) “Very flexible. . . I asked the recruiter to schedule
interviews during time that would not impact my activities. I was surprised when he proposed the first one on a Saturday morning.”
Interviews: 
Candidate interaction with the interviewers for positive and negative outcome.
Interviews can act as shepherd through a stressful interview.
Example: (What went wrong?) “The next interviewer was a very jaded engineer
who clearly didn’t want to be there. Unresponsive to questions. It was very
awkward and put me off in a major way.” 
(What went right?) “Interviewer was smart and polite; asking ‘logical’
questions rather than trying to show off or stump-the-candidate sort of
questions.” 
Hearing Back:
when someone not responding to messages then company was not interested in them. Example: (What went wrong?) “I can deal with rejection. I cannot deal with poor processes, especially when followed by a generic rejection letter, and no opportunity for feedback.” 
(What went right?) “Overall, the interview experience was pretty good and I got feedback in a decent amount of time.”
Offer and Negotiation:
This is the final stage of hiring process, it is a waste of time for company and candidates. Example: (What went wrong?) “The team matching progress is extremely slow and the recruiter is reluctant to arrange it. Took around three months to finish everything, way too long. Declined the offer without hesitation.”
(What went right?) “They were aware that I had a pending offer that I had to make a decision on, and were very good about moving the process along as quickly as possible.” 

CONCLUSION:
The hiring pipeline for software engineering has become ubiquitous with in industry as mean to recruit and selected candidates. Candidate to understand their experiences with in the hiring pipeline. To find how leaky hiring pipelines materialize across all of the stages of the pipeline. Our findings inform guidelines that if stand to make the hiring pipeline more inclusive.
